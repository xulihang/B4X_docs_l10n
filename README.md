# B4X_docs_l10n

I plan to use BasicCAT to translate B4X documents from English to Chinese.

The translation will start with booklets.

The Chinese workfile repo: https://github.com/xulihang/B4X_docs_l10n_zh

## How to start translating

1. Download and install BasicCAT.
2. Download this repo which contains the source files and the project file.
3. Clone the workfile repo and place the files with the source repo.
4. Use BasicCAT to open the project and start translating.
